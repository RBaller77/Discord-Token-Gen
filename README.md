## Requirements 

* Node.js 12 or Higher 

* Auto Clicker

## Tutorial

Start by initializing the bot

```bash
  npm init
```

install all the packages the bot requires

```bash
  npm install
```

Once done you may start up the bot by running the **run.bat**

I recomend not using a Capctha Key or Proxies and just by using an auto-clicker

If you IP has not been **flagged** or never been used with Discords capctha system is may not work


*I did* **NOT** *make this tool or condone the use of it this goes against Discords TOS use for educational use only*
